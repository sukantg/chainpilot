# Hedera Hackathon Submission Validator

Review a Hedera hackathon submission's codebase and score it against the official judging criteria. Focus on what is observable from the code, README, and documentation in the repository.

## Step 1: Discover the Project

Scan the codebase to understand what was built:

1. Read the README.md (or equivalent) for project overview
2. Identify the tech stack:
   - `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `requirements.txt`, etc.
   - Look for Hedera SDK dependencies (`@hashgraph/sdk`, `hedera-sdk-*`, etc.)
3. Find Hedera integration points:
   - Search for Hedera SDK imports and usage
   - Search for HTS precompile addresses (`0x167`)
   - Search for Hedera service calls (token create, consensus submit, etc.)
   - Search for mirror node API calls
   - Search for ecosystem integrations (wallet connect, DEX, etc.)
4. Assess project structure and code quality
5. Look for documentation: architecture docs, design decisions, business model, pitch materials
6. Check for tests and CI/CD configuration

## Step 2: Score Against Each Criterion

Evaluate the submission against each of the 7 judging criteria. For each, provide a score (1-5), evidence from the codebase, and specific improvement suggestions. Refer to `references/judging-criteria.md` for the complete rubric with guiding questions and 1/3/5 score descriptors.

### Innovation (10% weight)

Review for:

- Is this a novel solution or a clone of existing platforms?
- Does it introduce new capabilities to the Hedera ecosystem?
- Does the README explain what makes it unique?
- Check if similar projects exist (based on what you can infer from the code)

### Feasibility (10% weight)

Review for:

- Is the solution technically sound?
- Does it genuinely require Web3/blockchain? Or could this work on Web2?
- Is there a business model documented? (Lean Canvas, monetization strategy)
- Does the code demonstrate domain understanding?

### Execution (20% weight) - HIGHEST PRIORITY

Review for:

- **Completeness**: Is this a working MVP, PoC, or just scaffolding?
- **Code quality**: Clean architecture, error handling, testing?
- **UI/UX**: If there's a frontend, is it polished or rough?
- **Documentation**: README completeness, setup instructions, architecture docs
- **Design decisions**: Are key technical choices documented and justified?
- **Strategy**: Is there a roadmap or post-hackathon plan?
- **GTM**: Is there a go-to-market strategy documented?

### Integration (15% weight) - HIGH PRIORITY

Review for:

- **Services used**: Which Hedera services are actually integrated? (HTS, HCS, Smart Contracts, HFS, Scheduled Transactions)
- **Integration depth**: Is it meaningful usage or superficial? (e.g., just mirror node queries = shallow)
- **Ecosystem partners**: Are any ecosystem platforms integrated? (SaucerSwap, HashPack, etc.)
- **Creativity**: Is any Hedera service used in a non-obvious way?
- **Multiple services**: Are multiple Hedera services combined?

Rate integration depth:

- Mirror node queries only = 1 point
- Single service, obvious usage = 2-3 points
- Multiple services, meaningful usage = 3-4 points
- Multiple services + ecosystem partners + creative usage = 5 points

### Validation (15% weight)

Review for:

- Is there evidence of external user testing? (feedback docs, user survey results, analytics)
- Are market feedback cycles documented?
- Is there any traction data? (user counts, sign-ups, etc.)
- Note: This is hard to assess from code alone. Flag if no evidence is found.

### Success (20% weight) - HIGHEST PRIORITY

Review for:

- Does the solution architecture drive Hedera account creation?
- Would usage generate meaningful TPS on the network?
- Does it expose Hedera to new audiences?
- Is the potential network impact documented or estimable from the code?

### Pitch (10% weight)

Review for:

- README quality as a proxy for pitch quality
- Is the problem/solution clearly explained?
- Are metrics and market data cited?
- Is Hedera's role clearly articulated?
- Is there a pitch deck or demo script in the repo?

## Step 3: Generate the Scorecard

Output a comprehensive report:

```markdown
# Hackathon Submission Review

## Project Summary

- **Name**: [from README]
- **Description**: [1-2 sentences]
- **Tech Stack**: [languages, frameworks, Hedera SDK version]
- **Hedera Services Used**: [list]

## Scorecard

| Section     | Score    | Weight | Weighted | Key Finding        |
| ----------- | -------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------ |
| Innovation  | X/5      | 10%    | X.X      | [one-line summary] |
| Feasibility | X/5      | 10%    | X.X      | [one-line summary] |
| Execution   | X/5      | 20%    | X.X      | [one-line summary] |
| Integration | X/5      | 15%    | X.X      | [one-line summary] |
| Validation  | X/5      | 15%    | X.X      | [one-line summary] |
| Success     | X/5      | 20%    | X.X      | [one-line summary] |

| **Total**   | **X/35** |        | **X.X**  |                    |

**Estimated Final Grade: X%**

## Detailed Findings

### [Section Name] - X/5

**Evidence**: [What was found in the code]
**Gaps**: [What's missing]
**Quick Wins**: [Specific, actionable improvements]

[Repeat for each section]

## Top 5 Improvements (Ranked by Score Impact)

1. [Highest impact improvement] - affects [criteria] ([weight]%)
2. ...
3. ...
4. ...
5. ...

## Hedera Integration Depth Analysis

- Services detected: [list with evidence]
- Ecosystem integrations: [list or "none detected"]
- Creative usage: [describe or "none detected"]
- Recommendation: [specific services or integrations to add]
```

## Step 4: Prioritized Action Items

After the scorecard, provide a prioritized list of improvements ordered by impact on the final weighted score. Focus on:

1. **Execution improvements** (20% weight) - code quality, testing, documentation
2. **Success improvements** (20% weight) - network impact, account creation flows
3. **Integration improvements** (15% weight) - add more Hedera services, ecosystem partners
4. **Validation improvements** (15% weight) - add user feedback mechanisms

For each improvement, estimate the effort (quick fix, moderate, significant) and the potential score increase.

## Scoring Formula Reference

```
Weighted Score = (Score / 5) * (Section Weighting / 100 * 35)
Final Grade = (Sum of Weighted Scores / 35) * 100
```

## Important Notes

- Be constructive, not discouraging. Frame gaps as opportunities.
- Base scores on evidence found in the codebase, not assumptions.
- If you can't assess a criterion from the code (e.g., Validation, Pitch), say so explicitly and suggest how the team can document evidence.
- Refer to `references/judging-criteria.md` for the complete rubric with detailed 1/3/5 descriptors per criterion.
